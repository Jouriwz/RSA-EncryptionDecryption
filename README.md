# RSA Encryption/Decryption Flask App

This Flask application demonstrates the RSA encryption and decryption process, 
allowing users to calculate prime factors (p and q) from a given product of two primes (n), 
compute a suitable public key exponent (e), encrypt messages, calculate the private decryption key (d), 
and finally decrypt messages.
